# Aave

I wrote this program for the Dungeons and Data Visualisation challenge. 
I took the different data packages that they gave me and I added them together to make them easier to work with. 
After that, I subtracted the redeems/withdrawals from the deposits and the repays from the borrows to figure out the deposit balance and the loan balance. 
I also converted the value of each token into USD to then make easy comparable data. 
Finally I graphed both sets of data for a visual comparison to see the deposit balance and the loan balance.
